    "# Production Scheduling Optimization Using CMA-ES\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll use Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) to optimize a production scheduling problem, which is a fundamental challenge in industrial engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to determine the optimal batch sizes and sequence for producing multiple products on a single machine. This involves balancing three key objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Total Production Cost**: Setup costs plus production costs\n",
    "2. **Makespan**: The total time required to complete all production\n",
    "3. **Tardiness**: Delays in meeting delivery due dates\n",
    "\n",
    "These objectives often conflict with each other. For example, minimizing makespan might require smaller batches, which increases setup costs and affects total production cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing the required libraries and setting up our problem parameters."

    "4. **Worker constraints**: Considering shift schedules and labor availability\n",

    "Furthermore, alternative approaches to multi-objective optimization could be explored:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pareto optimization**: Finding the complete set of non-dominated solutions\n",
