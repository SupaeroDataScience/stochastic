Through simulating train networks as agents, this platform allows the development of policies for the efficient management of dense traffic on complex railway networks. We use this platform in a project on neuroevolution. In this project, students compete in teams of their choice of 1-6 people. They evolve policies for each train in the environment, either using the same genes for each agent or different genes. Policy representation, stochastic algorithm, and agent modelling decisions such as inter-agent communication are all up to the students. Using a fixed budget of evaluations, students must submit their results and the corresponding code for final evaluation. This project will take place in class on 01/12. Students are required to install the Flatland package beforehand and ensure a python environment capable of running the baseline scripts. Students are encouraged to explore the Flatland environment before the 01/12. This project coincides with an open competition on AIcrowd platform with material prizes. Extra credit will be given to students who make submissions to the online competition in addition to the class competition.","title":"Project"},{"location":"project.html#project-train-traffic-in-flatland","text":"The Flatland environment is a 2D gridworld for developing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
